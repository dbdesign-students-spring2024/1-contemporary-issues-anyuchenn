#The advantages and drawbacks of data collecting behind the COVID-19 Contact Tracing Apps

For this assignment, I will explore two different viewpoints on the **data collected of COVID-19 contact** tracing apps that used to address the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. The first article focuses on highlighting the advantages of utilizing collected data, while the second article delves into the drawbacks associated with its use.


##Article 1

The article [_The Tech Behind COVID-19 Contact Tracing_](https://www.gao.gov/blog/tech-behind-covid-19-contact-tracing) discussed the **benefits derived from the utilization of data collected** for addressing the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. They primarily focused on bluetooth method, a widely employed wireless technology for contact tracing, facilitates the exchange of anonymous codes between smartphones. They believed that these codes contain no information about the location or identity of users, thus prioritizing and safeguarding privacy. Upon downloading the app, users are alerted if they have been in close proximity to an individual who has tested positive for COVID-19. This notification system enhances transparency and allows individuals to take necessary precautions without compromising their privacy.

Also, they argued that in contrast to traditional contact tracing methods that demand a considerable workforce of trained contact tracers, contact tracing apps offer a more efficient and automated solution. Traditional methods involve identifying potentially exposed individuals, contacting them, and subsequently tracing their contacts. The digital nature of contact tracing apps expedites this process significantly. The automation not only saves time but also minimizes the risk of human error in identifying and notifying potential contacts.

##Article 2
 
The article [_Contact tracing apps for the COVID-19 pandemic_](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8042619/) identifies the **privacy concerns of covid-19 contact tracing apps**, including the potential abuse of user privacy rights. Citizens express apprehension regarding the safeguarding of their personal data and the risk of unauthorized access. Trust deficits in government and public health authorities further compound the resistance to app adoption. Ethical dilemmas, security vulnerabilities, user behavior, and participation, along with technical constraints, contribute to the multifaceted challenges faced by these technologies.

They suggests that developers should span enhancing privacy safeguards, building trust through transparent communication, addressing ethical considerations, fortifying security measures, and improving user engagement. The study emphasizes the need for a nuanced approach to digital contact tracing technologies, considering the socio-cultural and political context of each society.
